## **🍷 Red Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard**

## 

This project presents an interactive analysis of red wine quality using Power BI. It explores various physicochemical properties of red wine to understand how they relate to quality, and helps identify patterns in alcohol content, acidity, sulphates, and more.







#### **📁 Project Overview**

#### 

Objective: Analyze the chemical attributes of red wine and explore how they influence quality.



Dataset: Red Wine Quality dataset (commonly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle)



Tool Used: Power BI







#### **📊 Dashboard Preview**



> 🔴 Red Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard



This dashboard includes KPIs, donut charts, line plots, column charts, and custom visuals to uncover wine quality trends.







#### **🧪 Key Visuals \& Insights**

#### 

1\. Sum of Alcohol by Quality (Donut Chart)



* Wines with quality scores of 5 and 6 dominate alcohol content.
* Quality 6 has the highest alcohol contribution (over 40%).



2\. Sulfur Dioxide vs pH (Line Chart)



* Sulfur dioxide spikes between pH 3.2 to 3.4, indicating sensitivity of preservatives to acidity.



3\. Quality-Wise Contribution of Chemical Components (Column Chart)



* Shows how alcohol, sulphates, residual sugar, chlorides, and citric acid vary with quality.
* Higher quality wines show elevated levels of alcohol and sulphates.



4\. Fixed Acidity vs Density (Scatter/Histogram)



* Higher acidity is seen in denser wines.



5\. Sulphates by Density (Pie Chart)



* Color-coded by density to track sulphate contribution.



6\. KPI Cards



* Sum of Total Sulfur Dioxide: 74K
* Sum of Residual Sugar: 4.06K
* Sum of Citric Acid: 843.99
* Sum of Free Sulfur Dioxide (Gauge): 25K out of 51K possible







#### **📌 Business Insights**



🔹 Alcohol is a key positive contributor to wine quality.



🔹 High free sulfur dioxide levels are generally associated with medium-quality wines.



🔹 Moderate acidity and sugar levels support higher-quality ratings.



🔹 pH range between 3.2–3.4 is optimal in wine preservation.







#### **💡 Recommendations**



* Improve product quality by balancing alcohol, acidity, and sulphates.
* Monitor pH and sulfur dioxide carefully to avoid spoilage.
* Wines with low quality might be enhanced by adjusting residual sugar and citric acid levels.
