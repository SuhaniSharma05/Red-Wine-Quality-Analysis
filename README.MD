## **🍷 Red Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard**

## 

This project presents an interactive analysis of red wine quality using Power BI. It explores various physicochemical properties of red wine to understand how they relate to quality, and helps identify patterns in alcohol content, acidity, sulphates, and more.







#### **📁 Project Overview**

#### 

Objective: Analyze the chemical attributes of red wine and explore how they influence quality.



Dataset: Red Wine Quality dataset (commonly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle)



Tool Used: Power BI







#### **📊 Dashboard Preview**



> 🔴 Red Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard



This dashboard includes KPIs, donut charts, line plots, column charts, and custom visuals to uncover wine quality trends.







#### **🧪 Key Visuals \& Insights**

#### 

📌 *Average Alcohol by Quality*: Donut chart shows alcohol content increases with wine quality.


- 📌 *Average Chemical Properties by Quality*: Multi-feature comparison (alcohol, sulphates, chlorides, sugar, etc.)


- 📌 *Sulfur Dioxide vs pH*: Line chart shows peak at optimal pH.


- 📌 *Fixed Acidity vs Density*: Slight upward trend observed.


- 📌 *KPI Cards*: 


  - Volatile Acidity: 843.99

  - Total Sulfur Dioxide: 74K

  - Free Sulfur Dioxide: 25K

  - Residual Sugar: 4.06K













#### **📌 Business Insights**

✅ Higher quality wines (score 6–8) show significantly *higher alcohol content* on average.


- 🔻 Wines with *higher volatile acidity* tend to have *lower quality scores*.


- 🔬 *Sulfur dioxide levels* peak at wines with pH levels between *3.2 and 3.4*.


- 📉 Wines with *higher density* tend to have slightly *higher fixed acidity*.


- 🍬 Residual sugar content does *not strongly correlate* with wine quality.







#### **💡 Recommendations**



🧪 Focus on *alcohol content* and *citric acid* for producing higher-quality wines.
- 🚫 Monitor and control *volatile acidity* levels to avoid low ratings.
- 🎯 Optimize *pH around 3.2–3.4* to balance sulfur dioxide and taste.
- 🍷 Use this analysis to inform *product development, quality control, and pricing strategy*.
